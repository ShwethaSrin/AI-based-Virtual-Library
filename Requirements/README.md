Introduction

Due to busy life schedule we hardly get time to go to library and read book. Even we may not get access to all the books in the nearby library. And even we can not go to the library every time. Sometime we may face problems like after reading a book we may not find interesting and skip that book, that waste our time. So we need a platform where we can get a chance to read or listen to the summary of the book.

Research 
1.Virtual has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s. The term "virtual" has been used in the computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software" since 1959. In 1938.
2.Virtual library with 3d effect idea is  to improve the educational system and student intrest.

Defining a system 

We propose a virtual reality system in which the user will be immersed in a 3D world while moving. Reading ebooks, for example, would be done with the help of an Android smartphone. This will allow for the superimposition of actual and virtual world visuals, resulting in a whole new viewing experience. A web application has been designed for the admin, who can upload ebooks in pdf format. The pdf file is processed by the server to extract the text content from it. The complete text is processed for text summarization. User can listen and read the summary before reading the ebook. We can feel like moving around the virtual library and pick up book to read.

Features 

Web application is designed and easy access to all the admins to upload ebook. And easy to read a summary of books easily by users with fanatstic 3D view of libary.

Cost 

Cost  for the software system is free since it uses the open source software tools. cost for the hardware is 15K and depends on quality of head mounted display as per user requirement.
